<p>Some countries celebrate this day on December 25, some countries again on the evening of December 24. According to Roman Catholics, the official feast is December 25, also known as 'the main day of the day', and the night of the 24th of the month. 12 is called the “vigil”. However, the December 24 night ceremony usually attracts more news to attend. The Eastern Orthodox still use the Julian calendar to determine this date, so they celebrate Christmas on January 7 according to the Gregorian calendar.</p> <img src='../images/event/winter/01.jpg' alt=''><p style='font-size: 30px;'><strong>The word Christmas consists of the letters Christ and Mas</strong>    </p><p>The word Christ (the Anointed One) is the title of Jesus. The word Mas is an abbreviation for Mass. When the words Christ and Mas are written, it becomes the word Christmas. Christmas means the feast of Christ, that is, the feast of the Nativity of Jesus.The words Christmas and Xmas both have the same meaning. Because the Greek word for Christ is Christos, Spiotós or Xristos. People use the consonant X to represent the entire letter Xristos or Spiotós, then add the adjacent Mas to form the word Xmas. Thus Xmas also means the feast of Christ.</p><img src='../images/event/winter/05.jpg' alt=''><p>During the early Christian Church (first 2-3 centuries C.E.), this feast was celebrated with Epiphany. However, as early as the year 200, Saint Clement of Alexandria (150-215) spoke of a very special feast celebrated on May 20. And the Latin Church celebrates it on December 25. Another source is that early Christians did not celebrate birthdays, because they believed that celebrating birthdays was following the custom of pagan idolatry. That is why they did not celebrate the birth of Jesus during the first three centuries. In the 4th century, Christians began to want to celebrate the Nativity of Jesus once a year, but were afraid of being discovered and persecuted by the Roman authorities because by that time Christianity had not recognized as a legitimate religion.The Romans, every year, celebrated the 'Sun God' who brought light to the world on December 25. Christians took advantage of this opportunity to celebrate the birth of Jesus and bring light. Light and life came to mankind on the same day as the Roman 'Sun God' holiday. As a result, the authorities did not detect that Christians were celebrating the Nativity of Jesus.</p><img src='../images/event/winter/04.jpg' alt=''><p style='font-size: 30px;'><strong>Christmas symbols and meanings</strong></p><p>The Advent wreath is a circle made of green branches and leaves that is often placed on a table or hung high for all to see.
