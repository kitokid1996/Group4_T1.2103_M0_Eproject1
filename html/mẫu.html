    <p>The festival dates back to Harbin's traditional ice lantern show and winter garden party, which began in 1963. It was interrupted for a number of years during the Cultural Revolution, but was resumed when an annual event at Zhaolin Park was announced on January 5, 1985.</p>
    <p>In 2001, the Harbin Ice Festival was merged with the Heilongjiang International Ski Festival and had a new official name, the Harbin International Ice and Snow Sculpture Festival.</p>
