According to Roman Catholics, the official feast is December 25, also known as 'the main day of the day', and the night of the 24th of the month. 12 is called the “vigil”. However, the December 24 night ceremony usually attracts more news to attend. The Eastern Orthodox still use the Julian calendar to determine this date, so they celebrate Christmas on January 7 according to the Gregorian calendar.</p> <img src='../images/event/winter/01.jpg' alt=''><p style='font-size: 30px;'><strong>The word Christmas consists of the letters Christ and Mas</strong>    </p><p>The word Christ (the Anointed One) is the title of Jesus. The word Mas is an abbreviation for Mass. When the words Christ and Mas are written, it becomes the word Christmas. Christmas means the feast of Christ, that is, the feast of the Nativity of Jesus.The words Christmas and Xmas both have the same meaning. Because the Greek word for Christ is Christos, Spiotós or Xristos. People use the consonant X to represent the entire letter Xristos or Spiotós, then add the adjacent Mas to form the word Xmas. Thus Xmas also means the feast of Christ.</p><img src='../images/event/winter/05.jpg' alt=''><p>During the early Christian Church (first 2-3 centuries C.E.), this feast was celebrated with Epiphany. However, as early as the year 200, Saint Clement of Alexandria (150-215) spoke of a very special feast celebrated on May 20. And the Latin Church celebrates it on December 25. Another source is that early Christians did not celebrate birthdays, because they believed that celebrating birthdays was following the custom of pagan idolatry. That is why they did not celebrate the birth of Jesus during the first three centuries. In the 4th century, Christians began to want to celebrate the Nativity of Jesus once a year, but were afraid of being discovered and persecuted by the Roman authorities because by that time Christianity had not recognized as a legitimate religion.The Romans, every year, celebrated the 'Sun God' who brought light to the world on December 25. Christians took advantage of this opportunity to celebrate the birth of Jesus and bring light. Light and life came to mankind on the same day as the Roman 'Sun God' holiday. As a result, the authorities did not detect that Christians were celebrating the Nativity of Jesus.</p><img src='../images/event/winter/04.jpg' alt=''><p style='font-size: 30px;'><strong>Christmas symbols and meanings</strong></p><p>The Advent wreath is a circle made of green branches and leaves that is often placed on a table or hung high for all to see.

February 3 (sometimes the 4th depending on the year) is marked as the day before the start of a new season according to the lunar calendar. At this time, many places in Japan hold the Setsubun festival (Ectober). Although Setsubun is not a national holiday, it has all the great things about a great festival: from a fun atmosphere for the whole family to its own signature dishes of roasted soybeans and rice. sushi roll ehomaki. An interesting thing is that in the past, the number of beans was often doubled because it was considered a weapon to ward off evil. Let's find out some interesting things about Setsubun festival!</p><img src='../images/event/winter/19.jpg' alt=''>",
        "name"      :"<h2 class='name-Festival'>How is Setsubun Festival celebrated?</h2>",
        "content"   :"<p>In 2020, the Setsubun festival is held on February 3rd and as usual there will be 'mamemaki' activity - a custom that has been handed down since the 14th century (or even earlier). You will have to throw roasted soybeans and recite an exorcism spell. This interesting custom is very much loved andfollowed by young children. To perform the mamemaki ceremony properly, you need to buy a bag of fukumame(lucky beanbags) that are usually sold in most Japanese stores from early January and throw them out the door saying 'Oni wa soto!' (The devil get out!). This is mostly symbolic, attaching 'the devil' to the misfortunes of man.</p><img src='../images/event/winter/20.jpg' alt=''><p>Then you go out and throw roasted soybeans into the house while shouting 'Fuku wa uchi!', which means 'Happy inside!'. According to custom, you will eat a few 'indoor' beans. This is also the reason why people often pack them in plastic bags so that you can comfortably throw and eat the beans that fall on the floor.</p></p> style='font-size: 30px;'><strong>  How to celebrate Setsubun (other customs)</strong></p>    <p>Those are the basic steps to celebrate the Japanese Setsubun festival, but there are many other interesting details. The number of roasted soybeans you eat will correspond to your age, although there are also customs that say you should eat as many beans as your age plus one to prolong your life. Furthermore, in some families the oldest person is the family man or the man in his five years (2020 is the year of the Rat) will pretend to be the devil during the exorcism. This means they have to wear a plastic or paper demon mask (often sold as a set with a fukumame bag) and stand menacingly outside the door and have beans thrown at them. However, holding and dancing the pointed mace to look like a demon is quite dangerous and is often opposed by everyone.</p><img src='../images/event/winter/21.jpg' alt=''><p>Families in Kanto and Nara still keep their old customs by decorating their houses with fish heads and pointed sacred leaves to ward off evil spirits (because they believe that evil spirits will bring evil spirits). fear the leaves will poke them in the eye). But of course who wouldn't be so afraid, right?</p><p style='font-size: 30px;'><strong>The Biggest Setsubun Festivals in the Tokyo Area</strong></p><p>Although the Setsubun festival was previously performed at home, over the years it has evolved into a social event and many festivals have been covered in the media, hanging awards and many politicians as well as famous artists, actors or sumo wrestlers attended. One of the biggest events held is the Setsubun festival at Zojo-ji Temple in Tokyo and Naritasan Temple in Chiba Prefecture. At these large temples, more than a ton of roasted soybeans is thrown to the crowds that gather here on the festival day each February.</p><img src='../images/event/winter/22.jpg' alt=''><p>    Senso-ji Temple in Asakusa also hosts an equally impressive Setsubun festival, but there's this one that's most special. When the incantations 'Oni wa soto! Fuku wa uchi!' It is said that throughout Japan at this time, at Senso-ji Temple, the largest Buddhist temple dedicated to the Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara, it is believed that demons will never dare to appear before their guardian deity. That's why the spells in Asakusa were changed to 'Senshu banzei fuku wa uchi!' which means 'Eternal good fortune will come!'</p><p style='font-size: 30px;'><strong>What is Ehomaki?</strong></p><p>Peanuts aren't the only miracle food you might see during the Setsubun festival. Recently, Japanese people have also added ehomaki sushi rolls. Traditionally, ehomaki sushi rolls should be full of seven ingredients that represent Japan's Seven Lucky Gods (Shichifukujin). These ingredients can be anything like: cucumber, omelette (tamagoyaki), roast beef, scallops, etc. The details of each type of material are not so important. The most important thing is that you have to wrap them all together and not cut them after you're done. Normally, people will cut sushi rolls into small pieces but ehomaki is never cut because it is believed that it will mean 'cutting off' your luck.</p><img src='../images/event/winter/23.jpg' alt=''><p style='font-size: 30px;'><strong>How to eat Ehomaki?</strong></p><p>You can easily make Ehomaki at home or simply buy it at the store. Either way, you need to know how to eat it properly. Besides not cutting the rice roll, you need to pay attention when eating Ehomaki to sit very quietly and face the lucky direction of the year to pray for the god of luck to come to you.This tradition seems to have originated in the eastern part of Japan around the Edo period (1603-1868) and often changes position every year according to the rotation of the two poles of yin and yang. These mystical cosmic views are based on ancient Chinese philosophy. And rightly so, the 'direction of fortune' ehomaki is changed from year to year. As in 2020, this direction is West - Northwest, so if you want your ehomaki roll to work best during the year, you should bring a compass to measure it accurately!</p><p style='font-size: 30px;'><strong>Which Setsubun festival is right for you?</strong></p><p>If you have just arrived in Japan in early February, you can attend the Setsubun festival at temples throughout the capital. These festivals are lively and frenetic as everyone is scrambling for the beans, which is an amazing experience you can't find anywhere else. After finishing fighting for the beans, remember to buy ehomaki and eat while facing in the right direction to welcome the god of luck for the whole year!</p> <img src='../images/event/winter/24.jpg' alt=''>"

        "content"   :"<h3 class='title-Festival'>Sparkling festival of sky lanterns in Binh Khe, Taipei </h3><img src='../images/event/spring/Pingxi Sky Lantern/01.jpg'><p>Referring to the sky lantern festivals, it would be remiss to ignore the Binh Khe sky lantern festival - Pingxi Sky Lantern Festival - the biggest, brightest, most spectacular and most anticipated festival in Taiwan. This is the only festival in all of Taipei's traditional festivals that has been kept almost intact until now and grows bigger and bigger.</p><p style='font-size: 30px;'>Pingxi Sky Lantern Festival - Taipei</p><p style='font-size: 20px;'>1. The birth of Binh Khe sky lantern festival</p><p>This tradition comes from an old story. Pingxi (Pingxi) is a remote mountainous area in Taipei. During the reign of Emperor Daoguang of Ching Dynasty (1820-1850), residents from Fujian province were often robbed or murdered. So, after the harvest season, the villagers had to hide in the high mountains. When the robbers left on January 15, someone released a sky lantern, signaling safety and calling people home.</p><img src='../images/event/spring/Pingxi Sky Lantern/02.jpg'><p>Since then, on this day, people still keep the custom of releasing sky lanterns to signal peace. By the end of the 20th century, when the traditional values of the national culture were more focused, the sky lantern festival became a big event.</p><p style='font-size: 20px;'>2. Time and place of Binh Khe sky lantern festival</p><p>Binh Khe sky lantern festival is usually held annually on the 15th day of the first lunar month. The festival lasts about 1 week, at many different locations where sky lanterns are released. These locations are all approved and announced by the Taipei city government in advance. Each location has its own operating hours and regulations.</p><img src='../images/event/spring/Pingxi Sky Lantern/03.jpg'><p>Main venues: Jingtong Primary School and Pingxi Middle School. The closing ceremony and also the busiest holiday was held at Shifen Sky Lantern Square, Pingxi District, New Taipei City.</p><p>Organizer: New Taipei City Government (New Taipei)</p><p>Hours of operation: 18:00 to 21:00</p><p style='font-size: 20px;'>3. Unique features in Binh Khe sky lantern festival</p><p>The lights at the Binh Khe sky lantern festival are provided free of charge by sponsoring organizations. For the first 3 days, there are three sessions of light dropping each day. Sessions are held at three different locations. Visitors can also release their own lights at designated locations and times (usually every 20 minutes).</p><img src='../images/event/spring/Pingxi Sky Lantern/04.jpg'><p>The lantern is shaped like a basket, made of cotton paper. The lamp frame is made of bamboo slats. The wick is made of cotton, impregnated with kerosene. When the wick is ignited, the air inside heats up, and the lamp rises. On the body of the lamp, you will write your wishes and pray for your wishes to reach the gods.</p><img src='../images/event/spring/Pingxi Sky Lantern/05.jpg'><p>If you are lucky enough to attend the festival at the best time of the light-dropping session, you will admire a brilliant fanciful night sky with thousands of lights flying up. You will feel like you are lost in a fairy tale world. There is a shimmering light with many dreams and hopes. You will enjoy a moment of true relaxation. All troubles seem to fly away with each lamp.</p><img src='../images/event/spring/Pingxi Sky Lantern/06.jpg'><p>At the time of the festival, all roads to the area are closed. Fire trucks will be on hand to deal with any incidents. Cleaning units are also always on standby.</p><p style='font-size: 20px;'>4. The meaning of Binh Khe sky lantern festival</p><p>The Binh Khe sky lantern festival as well as in Taiwan in general has many special meanings. Taiwanese people believe that, when they write their wishes on a lamp and release it into the sky, God will read those wishes.</p><img src='../images/event/spring/Pingxi Sky Lantern/07.jpg'><p>Besides, the release of lights also shows the desire to reach high, wishing for luck and prosperity to come to everyone and every home.</p><p style='font-size: 20px;'>5. One and note when participating in Binh Khe sky lantern festival</p><p>On these days, people come to the festival site very crowded. Therefore, to avoid crowds, traffic jams, and hard travel, you should go early. You can rent a car in groups for convenience.</p><img src='../images/event/spring/Pingxi Sky Lantern/08.jpeg'> <p>Before releasing the lights, you can visit the ancient villages of Shifen and Jiufen. Jiufen Village is the village in the animated movie 'Spirited Away' by famous director Hayao Miyazaki.</p><img src='../images/event/spring/Pingxi Sky Lantern/09.png'> <p>Don't forget to bring your camera, camcorder to record the best images in the festival, and to have a picture of millions of likes to post on facebook!</p><p>Prepare your wishes in advance and write your wishes on the lantern.</p><p>Gently pull open the lantern so that all four upper corners are completely open. You should have someone hold the lantern at the bottom to ensure enough hot air enters the lamp.</p><p>Inspect the lantern for any external damage. Lanterns cannot fly if hot air is exposed.</p><p>After releasing the lamp, do not throw the lamp cover indiscriminately.</p><p>Pingxi Sky Lantern Festival is really worth experiencing when in Taiwan travel. If you have the opportunity to visit Taipei around January, don't miss the opportunity to attend this wonderful festival!</p>"
